# Predicting-Cradit-Card-Approval
Now-a-days,commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them are rejected for many reasons, for example high loan balances, low income levels,or many inquiries on an individual's credit report.Manually analyzing these applications is hard,    error-prone, and time-consuming.Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this notebook,i will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do!

for this project,I have used the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
